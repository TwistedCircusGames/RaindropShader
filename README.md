 Unity HDRP HLSL conversion of Martijn Steinrucken's Heartfelt shader

Thanks for watching the YouTube video! I really appreciate all 3 of you!

Instructions:
1. Drag the Shaders folder into your Unity HDRP project.
2. Drag the material in the Shaders folder onto a Quad and adjust the settings (if I implemented any, I've forgotten).
3. Profit.
